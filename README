This is fftp(1)

Fftp(1) is a program for FFT processing of ASCII waveforms.  Fftp(1)
will perform Welch's smoothing method on large data files and optionally
use the Chirp Z Transform to efficiently zoom into portions of the
frequency spectrum.

Fftp(1) also handles windowing, conversion to single-sided spectrum, and
DC-level correction/nulling.  Basically, it's just a solid workhorse for
generating Fourier spectra from evenly sampled real and complex data
sets. 

Fftp(1) outputs the resulting spectrum-analyzer data as an ASCII file
ready for plotting in pdplot, gnuplot, or other graphing package.

FFtp(1) is self-contained, using only stdio.h, stdlib.h and math.h.  Just
type "make" and then "make install".
